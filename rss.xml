            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Untold Story of Magic Leap, the World's Most Secretive Startup</h1><p>T There is something special happening in a generic office park in an uninspiring suburb near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Inside, amid the low gray cubicles, clustered desks, and empty swivel chairs, an impossible 8-inch robot drone from an alien planet hovers chest-high in front of a row of potted plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7af8ef04ab507d6eb2fda7bef0312a458fd1402.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team</h1><p>Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn't sure what she wanted to do with her life. She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn't a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efbf123856d3f3f6b4728c04eba0350714a5461e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Year 2026 - Where Virtual Reality Is Headed Over the Next Decade</h1><p>As time goes by it becomes more and more difficult to predict future trends. Back in 1920 it was fairly easy to predict where technology would likely be in say, 1930, but if you were to step back to 2006 and predict where things would be in 2016, more than likely you would have gotten a heck of a lot wrong.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/836ebee35d34a8c38c55c656cb194fdcbbf1f844.jpg"></article>]]></description>
