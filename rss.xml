            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Artificial Intelligence Reading List for 2016</h1><p>When I was an undergrad my favorite course was Introduction to AI, taught by Ira Pohl. When I graduated, I went to work in the AI department at BBN. I was working on, then state-or-the-art, projects involving machine learning, genetic algorithms, and expert systems. But that work, in the 80s, the end of a boom period for AI, felt very theoretical and researchy/experimental.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b4796b1368906e4d1210c704538b2d7a44a675db.jpg"></article>]]></description>

She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn't a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efbf123856d3f3f6b4728c04eba0350714a5461e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Back in 1920 it was fairly easy to predict where technology would likely be in say, 1930, but if you were to step back to 2006 and predict where things would be in 2016, more than likely you would have gotten a heck of a lot wrong.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/836ebee35d34a8c38c55c656cb194fdcbbf1f844.jpg"></article>]]></description>
