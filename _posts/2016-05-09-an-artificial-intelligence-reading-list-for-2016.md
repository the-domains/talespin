  When I was an undergrad my favorite course was Introduction to AI, taught by
  Ira Pohl. When I graduated, I went to work in the AI department at BBN. I was
  working on, then state-or-the-art, projects involving machine learning,
  genetic algorithms, and expert systems. But that work, in the 80s, the end of
  a boom period for AI, felt very theoretical and researchy/experimental.
